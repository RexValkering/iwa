To install the application on your localhost, follow these instructions:
1. Place the contents of this folder in a directory of your choice, for example /var/www/iwa/www.
2. Setup a local domain (for example localhost/iwa) and let it point to this directory.
3. Make a copy of include/iwa_config_sample.php named include/iwa_config.php, and configure it.
4. Make a copy of the Glassdoor and LinkedIn credential xml's, move them to the folder above this one (for example, /var/www/iwa) and fill in your developer credentials.
5. Your application should now be ready to run.
